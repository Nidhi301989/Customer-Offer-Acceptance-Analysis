# Customer-Offer-Acceptance-Analysis
Customer Offer Acceptance Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard analyzes customer behavior in response to promotional offers. By examining financial balances across four quarters (Q1–Q4) and key demographic factors like household size, credit rating, overdraft protection, and mailer type, the dashboard highlights trends and insights related to offer acceptance.

## Key Features
Offer Acceptance Distribution: Visualizes the number of customers who accepted vs. declined the offer.
Quarterly Balance Analysis: Compares average Q1–Q4 balances between customers who accepted and rejected the offer.
Household Size Insights: Highlights trends in customer balance behavior by household size.
Cross-Tab Analysis: Investigates relationships between offer acceptance and features like Overdraft Protection, Mailer Type, and Credit Rating.
Financial Categories: Segments customers into four categories based on average balance to explore offer response trends.

## How to Use
Filters: Use the filter controls for Offer Accepted, Overdraft Protection, and other dimensions to explore different segments.
Interactivity: The dashboard is dynamic—interact with charts and filters to view updated results.
Tooltips: Hover over data points to see detailed information.
Insights

## Offer Acceptance Imbalance: 
A large proportion of customers did not accept the offer.
Financial Trends: Higher balances in Q3 and Q4 correlate with offer acceptance.
Household Size Anomaly: A jump in balance for households of size 8, possibly due to limited data.

## Future Enhancements
Investigate the household size anomaly further.
Incorporate predictive analytics to determine key drivers of offer acceptance.
